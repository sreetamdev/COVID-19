# C3.AI Covid Challenge Data Analysis

**This is a data analysis challenge for COVID-19 to generate insights and trends majorly from the C3.AI Covid-19 Data Lake source**

In this this insights are generated only for Australia. Also, this project consists of  three data sources fetched from C3.AI Covid-19 Data Lake and two data sources which are not from the data lake.All of the are as follows:

- Johns Hopkins University: COVID-19 Data Repository - C3.ai COVID-19 datalake
- Apple: COVID-19 Mobility Trends                    - C3.ai COVID-19 datalake
- Google: COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports        - C3.ai COVID-19 datalake
- Corona Data Scrapper, timeseries data
- Covid-19 data hub, Covid-19 Data Hub csv.

## 1. Files
**Code script file** There are four code script files, which are as follows:
- NationalAuscases.ipynb - For analysing the Covid-19 traits and behaviours on a National level, Australia.
- Geolocation.ipynb- Performs analysis for the Covid-19 traits and behaviours on a state level
- GeoStateCases.ipynb- Defines Metrics for Covid-19 behaviours on a state-level for Australia.
- MobilityTraits.ipynb- Analyses the different mobility trends during Covid-19 for Australia.

**Data Analysis Tableau Dashboards**- All the exploratory data analysis has been done on Tableau dashboards, for which the links are:

-COVID-19 Traits & Insights, Australia,https://bit.ly/COVID-19TraitsInsights

-COVID-19 Traits & Insights, Statewise(AU),https://bit.ly/StatewiseCOVID-19TraitsInsights

-COVID-19 Mobility, https://bit.ly/Covid19Mobility

## 2. API Used
-**Data Lake API used**- 
1. Evalmetrics- Outbreak location

## 3. Launch

### 3.1. Technologies 

**1.Python**- Python programming language is utilized as a standalone base to solve the purpose of the project.

**2.Jupyter IDE**- Jupyter is utilized as a platform to write code scripts in python and do the data pre-processing, visualization, and Machine Learning tasks.

**Pandas**- Pandas library in python is put to use for data manipulation and analysis.

**3.NumPy**- NumPy library of python is used for statistical purposes and also for making use of multidimensional arrays.

**4.Matplotlib**-This library of python is used for data visualization.

**5.seaborn**- This library of python is used for data visualization.


**7.c3aidatalake**- To fetch the required datasets from C3.AI covid-19 datalake.

### 3.2. Launch

### 3.2.1. Setup

To run the code script please follow the steps below.

1. Install Anaconda(64-bit graphical installer version, if not previously installed), it can be installed via https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual

2.Launch Jupyter Notebook(version 6.0.3) from the anaconda navigator page or it can be directly launched from the terminal if Anaconda is previously installed(in case of MacBook).

3.Download the code script from this GitHub repository and save it in your working directory of Jupyter notebook. Alternatively, the code script can be uploaded directly in the jupyter notebook.

4.The required datasets also needs to be uploaded in the current working directory of jupyter.

5.Install the required libraries if not previously installed.

6.Import the list of libraries below.

7.Fetch the required data using the C3.AI API documentation

## 4. Project Status
This project is developed and can be used for further development.


## 5. Example of use

1.The Tableau Dashboards can be utilised for observing the COVID-19 cases and traits nationally for Australia and the states. 

2.The Tableau dashboards can also be put into application for observing and knowing the trends and mobility behaviours during COVID-19 pandemic.
